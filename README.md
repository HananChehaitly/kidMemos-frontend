KidMemos is a web application for parents to store souvenirs from their kids'childhood. They can upload images with titles and descriptions, 
filter through the memories by the kid's name or by the age, and search for a specific memory.

KidMemos was developed using React with Material UI for the frontend, Node.JS with Express.JS for the backend, and MySQL for the database. 
Also, KidMemos's backend is deployed to GitHub pages under KidMemos repository.

The authentication is done using **Google OAuth 2.0** which I implemented in Express.JS
